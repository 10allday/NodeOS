## introduction

Node-os is a lightweight system designed to run in a linux container.

Node-os wants to bring npm to the entire system.
Any package in npm is a node-os package,
which at last count was 56,594 packages.
The goal of node-os is to provide just enough to let npm provide the rest.
Since anyone can contribute to npm, anyone can create node-os packages.
